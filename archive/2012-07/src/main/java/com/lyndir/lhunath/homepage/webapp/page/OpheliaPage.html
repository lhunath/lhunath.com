            <p class="summary">On the 13th of June, 2008, for the first time, I held my beautiful little daughter.</p>

            <p>My life hasn't been quite the same since that day.</p>

            <h1>Birth</h1>

            <p>Only half a meter long, and barely over 2.75kg, she was alive and perfectly healthy. I'd heard stories of these things, but
               actually standing there and holding such a fragile, perplexed, confused and amazed little thing &mdash; it's something you
               can't really convey with words. I thought she was the best thing I'd ever experienced &mdash; and she was all mine! Well,
               partly my wife's too...</p>

            <h1>Development</h1>

            <p>As the months go by, I see her learning to understand her surroundings. And while I'd like nothing more, I can't fathom how
               her inner mind must work as she considers everything we do, everything she sees and feels. It's actually pretty amazing.</p>

            <p>Of all my attempts to create an AI, this one beats them all.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>While mostly just acting as a placeholder for the future, Ophelia has <a href="http://www.faelia.com">a website</a>.</li>
                <li>As soon as my latest project, Snaplog, opens up to the public you'll be able to follow Ophelia from there.</li>
            </ul>
