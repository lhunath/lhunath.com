<h2>&mdash; About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a Belgian software developer &mdash;<br>
I'm resident in Gatineau, nearby Ottawa, Canada &mdash;<br>
I'm passionate about the world, society and security &mdash;<br>
I'm an architect, a dreamer, a perfectionist, a writer and a stubborn idealist.</p>


<h2>&mdash; What I Do</h2>

<h3>Master Password &mdash;

<h4>Master Password is a unique solution to the password problem.</h4>

</ul>
<p>The standard secure approach to handling passwords and pass phrases is by generating these secrets randomly and storing them in a vault.<br>
Unfortunately, this is an extremely dangerous and fragile approach which decouples you from your own identity.  You've created a hardware or trust and availability dependency that sits between you and your services.</p>
<p>Master Password liberates you from this.  There is no vault.  No secret file or data.  No externals to trust.  Your identity is now your master password, a memorable phrase.<br>
To access your services, the Master Password algorithm acts as a secure calculator, deriving your service-specific key from your identity on-demand.</p>
<p>You can literally lose everything you own as a result of a natural disaster, legal action or accident today; all you need to regain access to your services tomorrow is your master password and a Master Password calculator.</p>

<h3>The Bash Guide &mdash;

    <a href="https://github.com/lhunath/guide.bash.academy/" class="fa fa-github" target="_blank"></a></h3>
<h4>A quality guide through the most popular terminal shell.</h4>
<ul class="gallery">

    <li><img src="img/bash-2.jpg"></li>
</ul>
<p>Bash is an extremely popular terminal shell for a variety of *NIX and other systems.  Unfortunately, its use and operation is often very unclear.  Documentation, both commercial and on the web are often extremely lacking, confusing and misleading.</p>
<p>The Bash Guide aims to set the record straight while being user-friendly and approachable.  It addresses the many features of the powerful shell in clear and direct language while inviting you to experiment using the countless examples and exercises.</p>
