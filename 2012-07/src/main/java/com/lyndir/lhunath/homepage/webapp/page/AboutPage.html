            <p class="summary">I am a software developer at <a href="http://www.lin-k.net">Lin.K</a> and a father of <a
                    href="/kids">three</a>.</p>

            <p class="notice">I am currently looking for projects or employment in Canada, with a focus on the Ottawa or Toronto areas.
                If you're a prospective employer or know of job-opportunities in these areas, get in touch via the <q>Contact</q> page
                (or see <a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/resume.html">my resume</a>).</p>

            <p>I'm mainly involved in Java web and iOS application development. Aside from that, I am also active a UNIX system
                administrator and all-round software and security consulting.</p>

            <h1>Professional</h1>

            <p>I've been professionally employed from the winter of 2007 at <a href="http://www.lin-k.net">Lin.K</a>, a modest but very
                ambitious software development and consulting company located near Ghent, Belgium. There, I've been working alongside two
                developers on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saml">SAML</a>/<a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid">OpenID</a>-based authentication and identity management service that
                strives to provide users with a global identity which connects their use of different applications into a seamless and
                shared experience while keeping the management and privacy-controls of all user data fully user-centric. </p>

            <p>Before then, I've been professionally active as a developer for <a href="http://www.secuteam.be">SecuTeam</a> where I
                developed a high-availability and load-balancing solution for their <a href="http://www.axsweb.be/Security.aspx?pageid=10">AXS
                Web Firewall</a> product and a user-friendly front-end for AXS Web managed SSH tunnels.</p>

            <h1>Personal</h1>

            <p>I've been married since the first of May, 2007 with my darling wife, Gillian. I have <a href="/kids">three forks</a> running
                amock: Ophelia, Theodore and George. We live a modest but happy life in Ghent, Belgium.</p>

            <p>I've traveled back and forth from Canada on multiple occasions and am planning to move back around the end of the year.</p>

            <p>I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">strong atheist</a> whose political views most closely match <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism">social liberalism</a>, and from time to time, I <a title="It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.
                - Sir Winston Churchill" href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/364.html">doubt democracy</a>.</p>

            <p>In my work, I'm a skeptical and often stubborn perfectionist with a strong sense of quality and design. I'm always interested
                in new technologies, ideas and approaches.</p>
