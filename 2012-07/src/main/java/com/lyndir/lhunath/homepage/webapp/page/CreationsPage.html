            <p>Here are some of the noteworthy projects I am or have been working on. Most of my work is Open Source. If you're interested
                in any of it, have a look at the source or <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> with me.</p>

            <h1>Current</h1>

            <h2><a href="http://masterpassword.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/MasterPassword.png" /> Master Password</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">Master Password is a revolutionary new way of managing passwords toi secure your online life.</p>

            <p>Memorising passwords or even saving them in our browser, an application or the cloud just isn't good enough.</p>

            <p>Master Password is a solution that voids the need to keep your passwords anywhere. Not in your head, not on your computer and
                not in the cloud. Nothing to store means nothing to loose. At the same time it makes sure that your accounts are adequately
                protected with exclusive passwords.</p>

            <p>With Master Password, you remember one secure password and use that with the application to generate any password you might
                need. You could even generate PIN codes with it, if you wanted. Today, it's time to stop worrying about passwords and get on
                with what we need to get done.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://gorillas.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/Gorillas.png" /> Gorillas</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">Gorillas is the clone of an arcade classic to the iPhone / iPod touch.</p>

            <p>Two gorillas stand on roof tops and take turns at throwing explosive bananas at each other. With the right angle and speed,
                taking into account the current wind velocity, your banana should obliterate the opponent on impact.</p>

            <p>The iPhone / iPod touch features a touch screen which lends itself perfectly for making these throws a real piece of cake.
                Just a single tap indicates the vector of your banana's initial velocity.</p>

            <p>Of course, the game features some tasty eye-candy, fully rendered in OpenGL. You can pick from several cities to fight in,
                each with a unique feel through a change in gravity and wind strength.</p>

            <p>You can also pick from several different game types, such as a classic game of Gorillas, a more dynamic game with
                auto-adjusting difficulty, a teamed game, or a last-man-standing free-for-all. </p>

            <h2><a href="http://deblock.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/DeBlock.png" /> DeBlock</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">DeBlock is an arcade block destruction game for the iPhone / iPod touch.</p>

            <p>A field is filled with blocks of random colors. Blocks that neighbour other blocks of the same color can be destroyed by
                tapping them. Surrounding blocks collapse and fold back into a new pile. The objective is to destroy all the linked blocks
                in the field in such an order that you end up with no more than 8 unlinked blocks. Clearing the field completely grants you
                a flawless bonus.</p>

            <p>Some blocks are special in a certain way. They are marked with a certain symbol and perform a special action when triggered.
                Some special blocks blow up all the blocks around them, others zap all blocks of their color, etc. Using them strategically
                is key at getting the better score and succeeding at later levels.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/bashlib"> <img src="images/media/bashlib.png" /> BashLib</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">BashLib is a library of convenience functions for the GNU Bash shell.</p>

            <p>Bash is the POSIX-compliant shell you find on most any UNIX system. This library makes it a little easier to make sane and
                appealing bash scripts.</p>

            <p>Amoungst the many features it provides are <code>emit</code> which displays messages with coloured syntax (and is a wrapper
                for the next:), <code>spinner</code> which provides several types of spinners to keep the user enthralled while waiting for
                some lengthy task to complete, <code>ask</code> being a simple function that makes taking user input just that little bit
                easier (featuring default options and such) and <code>showHelp</code>, an easy way to show some documentation on your
                script's usage. For more info, see the extensive comments inside.</p>

            <h1>Pre-Historic</h1>

            <h2><a href="https://central.lyndir.com/"> <img src="images/media/central.png" /> Network Monitor</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">The Central Network Monitoring system is a PHP based web application which allows companies to keep an eye on
                the status of their entire network infrastructure.</p>

            <p>It provides a convenient interface for browsing network machines and hardware, evaluating their current and past status and
                updating hardware configurations as the network infrastructure evolves.</p>

            <p>Alerts can be set to warn administrators when certain hardware begins to underperform or fails.</p>

            <p>Data is collected through SNMP daemons which are supported by Linux, OS X, Windows, and most other network-connected
                devices.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/old/NetherPanel"> <img src="images/media/netherpanel.png" /> NetherPanel</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">NetherPanel is a <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a> manager built for use through
                WebStart.</p>

            <p>It's basically a tool for addon management and uploading character data to web applications such as the <a
                    href="http://www.wowroster.net">WoWRoster</a>.</p>

            <p>It features advanced addon dependency management and tools that make browsing the mass of addons provided for the game less
                of a time-consuming and headache-inducing task.</p>


            <h2><a href="http://www.riello.be"> <img src="images/media/riello.png" /> Riello NV</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">This is the homepage of the Belgian branch of the Italy-based heating systems producer Riello.</p>

                panels.</p>

            <p>This website mostly provides information on the products provided by Riello, where distributors can be found, and it also
                provides a wide range of technical documentation for professionals.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://bleach.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/bleach.png" /> Bleach</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">I designed this website for the Bleach World of Warcraft guild.</p>

            <p>It provides the members with a central location for news, a message board, a member information roster, and a recruitment
                page.</p>

            <p>The website was made with integration between the components in mind. The site itself uses the board's authentication
                mechanism and data to provide users with a <a href="http://nesia.bleach.lyndir.com/">custom homepage</a> and more.</p>


            <h2><a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/old/myst"> <img src="images/media/lhunath-old.png" /> Lhunath's Old Website</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">This website has had different faces, here's the previous one.</p>

            <p>The content is fairly similar to that of the current site, albeit significantly outdated.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/old/forest"> <img src="images/media/lhunath-old.png" /> Lhunath's Really Old Website</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">Just like many of us; I've also had my younger years of ignorance.</p>

            <p>And as proof remains this website which is now thankfully superseded by the current one.</p>

            <p>The site contains some of my younger attempts of having a view on life without being able to make much sense in expressing
                them.</p>


            <h2><a href="http://stuff.lhunath.com/old/moonlit/html/frameset.html"> <img src="images/media/moonlit.png" /> Moonlit Bookstore</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">Back in the days of college I wrote this little demonstration site for a web design class.</p>

            <p>It doesn't really do anything, and it's horribly tiny on today's resolutions, just because I was apparently too stupid to
                understand the concept of scaling websites - nevertheless, it's fun to see where one comes from.</p>
