            <p class="summary">I am a software developer at <a href="http://www.lin-k.net">Lin.K</a> and a father of <a href="/ophelia">one</a>.</p>

            <p>My main occupation is Java web application development. Aside from that, I am also active as an iPhone application developer,
               UNIX system administrator and all-round software and security consulting.</p>

            <h1>Professional</h1>

            <p>I've been professionally employed from the winter of 2007 at <a href="http://www.lin-k.net">Lin.K</a>, a modest but very
               ambitious software development and consulting company located near Ghent, Belgium. There, I've been working alongside two
               developers on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saml">SAML</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid">OpenID</a>-based
               authentication and identity management service that strives to provide users with a global identity which connects their use
               of different applications into a seamless and shared experience while keeping the management and privacy-controls of all user
               data fully user-centric. </p>

            <p>Before then, I've been professionally active as a developer for <a href="http://www.secuteam.be">SecuTeam</a> where I
               developed a high-availability and load-balancing solution for their
                <a href="http://www.axsweb.be/Security.aspx?pageid=10">AXS Web Firewall</a> product and a user-friendly front-end for AXS
               Web managed SSH tunnels.</p>

            <h1>Personal</h1>

            <p>I've been married since the first of May, 2007 with my darling wife, Gillian. My <a href="/ophelia">only daughter</a> was
               born in June, 2008. We live a modest but happy life in Ghent, Belgium.</p>

            <p>I've traveled back and forth from Canada on multiple occasions and consider eventually going back there.</p>

            <p>I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">strong atheist</a> whose political views most closely match
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism">social liberalism</a>, and from time to time, I
                <a title="It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.
                - Sir Winston Churchill" href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/364.html">doubt democracy</a>.</p>

            <p>In my work, I'm a skeptical and often stubborn perfectionist with a strong sense of quality and design. I'm always interested
               in new technologies, ideas and approaches.</p>
